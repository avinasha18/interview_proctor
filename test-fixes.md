# 🐛 Bug Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Event Display Issues
**Problem**: Events were showing as "book detected" instead of proper event types
**Solution**: 
- Fixed event deduplication logic in Python service
- Improved event formatting with proper capitalization
- Added unique event keys for different object types

### 2. ✅ Video Stream Not Stopping
**Problem**: Video continued streaming after interview ended
**Solution**:
- Added `isInterviewActive` prop to VideoCapture component
- Added useEffect to stop streaming when interview becomes inactive
- Proper cleanup of WebSocket connections

### 3. ✅ Duplicate Event Spam
**Problem**: Same events were being logged multiple times per second
**Solution**:
- Implemented event deduplication with 3-second cooldown
- Added `should_send_event()` method to check timing
- Added `record_event_time()` to track last event times

### 4. ✅ Object Detection Improvements
**Problem**: Limited object detection, couldn't detect pens
**Solution**:
- Upgraded from YOLOv5 to YOLOv8 for better accuracy
- Expanded target objects list to include pens, pencils, notebooks, etc.
- Improved confidence threshold handling

### 5. ✅ Detection Frequency Optimization
**Problem**: Too many events being generated
**Solution**:
- Added 3-second cooldown between same event types
- Improved event filtering logic
- Better session management

## Key Changes Made

### Python Service (`app/proctoring_service.py`)
- ✅ Added event deduplication system
- ✅ Upgraded to YOLOv8 model
- ✅ Expanded object detection list
- ✅ Improved event timing logic

### Frontend (`client/src/components/VideoCapture.jsx`)
- ✅ Added interview active state monitoring
- ✅ Automatic video stream stopping
- ✅ Better cleanup on component unmount

### Frontend (`client/src/App.jsx`)
- ✅ Pass interview active state to VideoCapture
- ✅ Improved prop management

## Testing Instructions

1. **Start the system**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Test event deduplication**:
   - Start an interview
   - Show a phone/book multiple times
   - Verify events are logged only once every 3 seconds

3. **Test video stopping**:
   - Start monitoring
   - End the interview
   - Verify video stream stops automatically

4. **Test object detection**:
   - Show different objects (pen, phone, book, etc.)
   - Verify proper object names in events
   - Check confidence scores

5. **Test focus detection**:
   - Look away from screen for >5 seconds
   - Verify focus lost event appears
   - Look back and verify no duplicate events

## Expected Behavior Now

- ✅ Events appear with proper names (e.g., "Cell Phone detected!", "Pen detected!")
- ✅ No duplicate events within 3-second windows
- ✅ Video stops automatically when interview ends
- ✅ Better object detection including pens and other items
- ✅ Cleaner event log with proper formatting
- ✅ Improved performance with reduced spam

## Performance Improvements

- **Event Frequency**: Reduced from ~1 event/second to ~1 event/3 seconds
- **Object Detection**: Better accuracy with YOLOv8
- **Memory Usage**: Better cleanup and session management
- **User Experience**: Cleaner UI with proper event display
